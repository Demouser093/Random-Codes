Learning Objectives: 
• Define penetration testing terms
• Explain the purpose of penetration testing.
• List the phases of penetration testing.
• Identify the different approaches to penetration testing.


1.Define penetration testing terms:
    As a penetration tester, your role involves finding and addressing security 
    weaknesses in an organization's systems. Here's an explanation of the terminology:

1. Penetration Testing:
   Security testing method simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities 
   in applications, systems, or networks.

2. Network Discovery:
   The process of locating active hosts, identifying weaknesses, and understanding network 
   design within a network.

3. Port Scanner:
   A program used to remotely check open ports on a system and determine if connections are 
   allowed through those ports.

4. Rules of Engagement (ROE):
   Detailed guidelines and constraints for conducting penetration testing.

5. Target:
   The specific application, system, IT infrastructure, or environment that a tester 
   aims to infiltrate.

6. Vulnerability:
   A weakness in security procedures, administrative controls, or internet controls that 
   could be exploited by a threat.

7. Exploit:
   A piece of code used by the penetration tester to take advantage of a vulnerability in 
   the target system.

8. Enumeration:
   The process used by a penetration tester to gather information about entry points, which 
   are either verified or disproved during the exploitation phase.

9. Attack Vector:
   A path or means by which an attacker can access a computer or network server to deliver a 
   harmful payload.

10. Payload:
    A component of the attack used by the penetration tester to compromise the confidentiality, 
    integrity, or availability of the target system.

11. Shell:
    A piece of code or script running on a server that allows for the execution of commands on the system.


Goals and Benefits of Penetration Testing:

1. Expert Assessment: Penetration testers are experts in real-world threats, attack paths, and vulnerabilities,
 and they assess an organization's preparedness for actual attacks.

2. Improved Security: Penetration testing is a valuable tool for organizations to enhance the security of their 
infrastructure, networks, applications, systems, and data.

3. Resource Allocation: It helps organizations identify where to allocate limited time and resources to mitigate 
threats effectively, such as deciding on security investments or implementing two-factor authentication.

4. Identifying Critical Vulnerabilities: Penetration testing pinpoints critical vulnerabilities, allowing organizations 
to make informed decisions about prioritizing security measures.

5. Holistic Cyber Risk Assessment: It provides a holistic view of cyber risk by showing how a weakness in one area of 
the organization's technology can lead to breaches in other interconnected systems.


Penetration Testing Phases:

1. Plan:
   • Pre-engagement activities and preparation for the penetration test.
   
2. Discover:
   • Information gathering and scanning for vulnerabilities to kickstart the testing process.

3. Attack:
   • Verification of previously identified vulnerabilities through exploitation.

4. Report:
   • Simultaneously collects evidence and documents the Rules of Engagement (ROEs), test steps, and results.


Penetration Test Styles:

1. Black Box:
   • Conducted with no prior knowledge of the target environment.
   • Minimal information, possibly just the organization's name.
   • No code examination in internal environments.
   • Focus on identifying vulnerabilities exploitable from outside the network.

2. Gray Box:
   • Involves limited information about the target, often login credentials.
   • Helps assess the potential access and damage a privileged user could achieve.
   • Offers a balance between black box and white box testing.

3. White Box:
   • Tester has complete knowledge of the target environment, including systems, networks, source code, and more.
   • Reduces test time and cost by not requiring extensive reconnaissance.
   • Simulates an internal attack to identify various weaknesses and security exposures in detail.


Penetration Testing Methodologies:

1. Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES):
   • Developed by a team of information security practitioners.
   • Aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date standard for penetration testing.
   • Guides security professionals and informs businesses about what to expect from a penetration test.
   • Covers preengagement interactions, intelligence gathering, and threat modeling.

2. Open-Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM):
   • Maintained by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM).
   • Offers a peer•reviewed methodology for security testing.
   • Focuses on testing operational security across five channels: Human Security, Physical Security, 
     Wireless Communications, Telecommunications, and Data Networks.

3. Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF):
   • Provides a structured and specialized approach to penetration testing.
   • Allows meticulous planning and documentation of each step in the penetration testing process.
   • Offers information and attack vectors for vulnerable areas, along with potential outcomes of exploiting vulnerabilities.


Determining Penetration Test Scope:

1. Identify Customer Concerns:
   • Understand the customer's worries, such as compliance, revenue loss, or reputation damage.

2. Assets to Be Tested:
   • Determine which assets, like servers or applications, the customer wants to assess for security.

3. Potential Threats:
   • Explore the likely threats and risks the customer is concerned about.

4. Goals of the Test:
   • Clarify what the customer hopes to achieve with the penetration test.

5. Constraints and Limitations:
   • Identify any restrictions or limitations on the test, such as testing hours or certain systems to exclude.

Based on the answers, define:
• Targets: IP addresses, subnets, domains, and applications to test.
• Exclusions: Document areas or assets to avoid testing.
• Testing Exploits: Discuss with the customer the types of exploits to use.
• Intrusion Level: Determine the depth of intrusion to explore.
• Test Type: Choose from options like server-side, client-side, local, network, wireless, web application, social engineering, or physical security.
